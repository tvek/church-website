Mary is the one whom God created in the model of this lost Paradise. Mary reestablished the virtues, holiness and the celestial beauty which Eve, the first woman had forfeited.\n\nThe Son of God, who is in fact, the sun of justice and eternal Sun, took flesh from Mary and dwelt in her. Mary was the daughter of S.S Anna and Joachim. She was always obedient to her parents.\n\nAssumption of The Holy Virgin Mary, Mother Of God (Shoonoyo) celebrated in the church with more importance on August 15.",

  "saintThomasDescription": "St. Thomas is one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. He is one who directly and personally experienced Jesus. His Christ experience was so deep and intense that he took up joyfully the hazardous long journey to India and shared it with our forefathers. Thus he became the apostle of India. Mar Thomma Margam is the special Christian life-style, initiated by him here in India. He sacrificed his own life in order to bear witness to this particular life-style.\n\nSt. Thomas expressed his supreme love of God by proclaiming his readiness to die with Jesus. He was instrumental for clarifying the redemptive role of Jesus. He himself was fortunate to bear witness to the Resurrection of Jesus as the representative of the twelve.\n\nOn Pentecost day the apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they went to the different parts of the world to bear witness to Jesus the Redeemer. The destination of St. Thomas was our own motherland India.\n\nSt. Thomas reached India in 52 A. D. Having arrived at Maliyankara (Kodugalloor), he traveled from one end of Kerala to the other and established 7 churches (faith-communities) there. They are: Kodugalloor,Paloor, Kottakkavu(Paravoor), Kokkamangalam,Niranam, Kollam and Chayal(Nilakal). He also established the famous 'Arappally' at Thiruvithakodu with help of 'Aracha' kings. In Mylapore (Madras), he embraced martyrdom in the year 72 A. D. The tomb of St. Thomas is venerated to this day in the Cathedral Church of Mylapore in Madras.",

His Grace blocked the move of Patriarch Abdullah, who came to Malankara in 1910 to seize control of Malankara Church.
